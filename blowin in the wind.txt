how many roads must a man walk down

before you call him a man

how many seas must a white dove sail

before she sleeps in the sand

how many times must the cannon balls fly

before they are forever banned

the answer my friend is blowin in the wind

the answer is blowin in the wind

how many years can a mountain exist

before it is washed to the sea

how many years can some people exist

before they are allowed to be free

how many times can a man turn his head

and pretend that he just does not see

the answer my friend is blowin in the wind

the answer is blowin in the wind

how many times must a man look up

before he can see the sky

how many ears must one man have

before he can hear people cry

how many deaths will it take till he knows

that too many people have died

the answer my friend is blowin in the wind

the answer is blowin in the wind
