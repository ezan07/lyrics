imagine there is no heaven
it is easy if you try
no hell below us
above us only sky
imagine all the people living for today

imagine there is no countries
it is not hard to do
nothing to kill or die for
and no religion too
imagine all the people living life in peace you

you may say I am a dreamer
but I am not the only one
I hope some day you will join us
and the world will be as one

imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
no need for greed or hunger
our brotherhood of man
imagine all the people sharing all the world you

you may say I am a dreamer
but I am not the only one
I hope some day you will join us
and the world will live as one
